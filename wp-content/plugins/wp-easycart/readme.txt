= What are the PRO and Premium eCommerce Versions? =
FREE version comes from WordPress and offers limited features for you including PayPal standard, manual payments, unlimited products, product variations, order management, and so much more. Features such as coupons, live shipping rates, promotions, and many more are not included in the FREE version.

Yes!  EasyCart works on 3 WordPress pages, which are automatically created on installation.  Our installer walks you through the steps quickly and if you have any theme issues, your theme developer or our staff can assist.
